# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to visualise kickstarter campaign outcomes and draw conclusions based on campaign’s launch dates and respective funding roles. 

## Analysis and Challenges

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date - Deliverable 1

### Figure 1. Line Graph Representing Outcomes of Theatre Kickstarter Campaigns Based on Campaign Launch Month

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals - Deliverable 2

### Figure 2. Line Graph Representing the Likelihood of Outcomes of Kickstarter Campaigns for Plays Based on Fundraising Goal Amount in Dollars 

## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I believe a challenge faced when interpreting this data lies in the categorization of projects given only a parent category and subcategory. Many kickstarter projects are interdisciplinary and likely very tough to categorise given only two words. This leads to data that likely does not capture the full picture given lack of nuance in categorisation. 

A difficulty I personally faced when analysing the data was in converting the launched_at column into a Converted Creation Date given in YYYY-MM-DD format. I believe the original format used wasn’t intuitive and tough to manipulate. 

## Results - Deliverable 3

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Kickstarter campaigns in theatre are most commonly launched in the spring.
The launch month that leads to the highest likelihood of campaign fundraising success for theatre projects is the month of May.

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Kickstarter’s with lower fundraising amount goals are more likely to succeed. 

### What are some limitations of this dataset?

Too few categories used to describe a project. Leaving pertinent data points out of specific filtered searches.

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
